# COE608
COE608 Computer Organization and Architecture labs.

This course covered the basic architecture of modern computers, interaction between computer hardware and software at various levels, and performance evaluation and metrics. Instruction set design, computer arithmetic, data path and control unit design for RISC Processors, and pipelining are covered in detail. 

The labs include the design and implementation of a 16-bit RISC CPU using an Cyclone IV FPGA device and VHDL.
